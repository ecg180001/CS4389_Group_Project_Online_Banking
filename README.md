# Online Banking
Welcome to our group project, where we are building a secure application for online banking. This application allows users to login, securely make transactions, view account details, and more.

> Note: This application is still a work in progress. Currently, we are finalizing our documentation and plans for API routes, page routes, components, security, database, and architecture. Once we finalize the plans, we will start working on the features in separate branches and merge to main as they are completed.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Architecture

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The current architecture uses React, Next-Auth, and Mantime for the front end. And Next.js and Firebase for the backend.
